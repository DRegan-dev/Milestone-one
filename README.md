Validator Testing
HTML

CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
On smaller screens the buttons can sometimes display behind the main landing page video background or behnd the video on the video dropdown page.
There is unused white space to the right of the page border. 
Research was carried out to discover why this was these things occured but no fruitful results were obtained. It is suspected to be due to positioning of the elements and potentially the display style used for some elements.

A toggle button was incorporated for the the nav bar but getting it to function required the use of javascript and as this is a html css based site. The idea was abandoned.
