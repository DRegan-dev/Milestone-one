## Validator Testing
### HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
### CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Fixed bugs

Video display appearing out sidewidth of parent element on smaller screens. Fixed by adjusting positioning in media queries.
Excessive vertical and horizontal scroll fixed.

## Unfixed Bugs

On smaller screens the buttons can sometimes display behind the main landing page video background or behnd the video on the video dropdown page.
There is unused white space to the right of the page border. 
Research was carried out to discover why these things occured but no fruitful results were obtained. It is suspected to be due to positioning of the elements and potentially the display style used for some elements. Further research into this was conducted and alterations made to the position: absolute and position:relative styles but issue still persisted. 

Weekly hour limit was reached on github and could not correct signup sheet validation and submission and filepaths in directory. 

A toggle button was incorporated for the the nav bar but getting it to function required the use of javascript and as this is a html css based site. The idea was abandoned. 


## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
